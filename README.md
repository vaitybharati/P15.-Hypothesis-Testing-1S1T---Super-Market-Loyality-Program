Population Parameters: Mean=120 Sample Parameters: n=80, Mean=130, SD=40, df=80-1=79 1-sample 1-tail ttest 

Assume Null Hypothesis Ho as Avg spending <= $120. Thus Alternate Hypothesis Ha as Avg spending > $120.

As (p-value = 0.014) < (Î± = 0.05); Reject Null Hypothesis Thus Avg spending > $120; we can go ahead and launch Loyality program.
